		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				Kaladin is one of the protagonists of the New York Times Best Selling fantasy series, The Stormlight Archive. This page contains many details about Kaladin's
				background. It is prefaced by a quick guide to the setting of the series with relevant terminology for the following biographical sections. Please note that
				this page contains spoilers for the first book of the series: The Way of Kings.
			</p>
		<h2>Guide to Roshar</h2>
			<h3>Vorinism</h3>
				<p>
					Roshar is the fantastical planet were The Stormlight Archive takes place. It has one main continent with a multitude of nations, geographies, and cultures.
					Of most relvance are the Vorin Nations: Alethkar, Jah Keved, Thaylenah, and Kharbranth (please note this list is in descending order of power, wealth,
					and population). Vorinism enforces a strict caste system divided into to subdivisions: Dahn and Nahn. There are also very strict gender roles which model
					typical feudal tropes with the addition that only women are allowed to be literate. A critical tenet of the religion is the ability rise within society
					through exceptional skill, wealth, or valor. It is comparatively easy and common to elevate from lower nahn or dahn to the next one even within a lifetime.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dahn is the caste for the higher ruling class and composed of the lighteyes: who are individuals with lightly colored-bright eyes,
					such as blue, green, yellow, light grey, or violet. Those of the first dahn are monarchs and their immediate successors. All landed lighteyes are of
					the sixth dahn or higher. Members of the tenth dahn are landless lighteyes who must work for a living much like a higher nahn darkeyes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Nahn caste is for the lower class which is composed of the darkeyes: those with dark colored eyes, such as brown or black. Notably not all darkeyes
					are serfs. Those of first and second nahn are normally artisans, merchants, or other wealthy tradesman. In practical terms of wealth, they can often
					outrank some of the lower dahn lighteyes in society. Darkeyed members of the lowest tenth dahn are slaves and must be payed half of what a normal laborer
					would be paid for the same work. Practically all darkeyes are granted the right of travel which acts as a check against lighteyed oppression.
				</p>
			<h3>Shardblades & Shardplate</h3>
				<p>
					Shardblades are ancient mythical swords roughly 6 feet
					in length that can cut through anything. Non-living material is sliced, while living objects have their soul cut instead, thus a single sweep of a shardblade
					can incapacitate well over a dozen enemies on a battlefield at once. Shardplate is the compliment to a shardblade; it is armor that grants super-human agilty
					and strength. Shardplate's true power is in its ability to block shardblade strikes and the absence of chinks found in normal armor (with the eye-slit being
					the sole chink). When an individual posesses a shardblade and a set of shardplate, they are considered a full shardbearer.
				</p>
			<h3>Alethkar</h3>
				<p>
					Much of the story takes place in Alethkar the most militaristically dominant of the nations on the continent. This is due to an amalgamation of heavy
					militaristic culture, wealth, and possession of nearly 20 full shardbearers. The kingdom is composed of 10 highprincedoms, each ruled over by a highprince
					of second dahn. Roughly 8 years before Kaladin's birth, Gavilar Kholin (one of the highprinces) succedeed in reunifying the country and was named king.
					The reunification war was long and bloody and led to forced allegiance under King Gavilar, but there was still much strife and infighting between the various
					highprinces.
				</p>
		<h2>Family Members</h2>
			<h3>Father: Lirin</h3>
				<p>
					Born high nahn darkeyes he was able to travel to Kharbranth, the city of Bells, as message courier where was inspired to become a surgeon.
					He has a fierce pacifist mentality and wants his son to follow in his footsteps. Lirin was incredibly dissappointed
					by Kaldin joining the military and upon reuniting many years after Kaladin's enlistment he urges Kaladin to retire and resume his training as a surgeon.
				</p>
			<h3>Mother: Hesina</h3>
				<p>
					Born the daughter of a wealthy darkeyed father and a low nahn lighted mother Hesina grew up in extremely priviliged circumstances for a darkeyed woman.
					She is a feircly devout Vorin worshipper and extremely witty. She loves her husband and supports him in his decision to not charge for his work. When her
					husband's patients do not offer sufficient donations to feed her family, she serves as a day laborer for others in town performing menial and undesirable
					tasks.
					
				</p>
			<h3>Brother: Tien</h3>
				<p>
					Kaladin's younger brother was always small for his age. He is also unable to stand the sight of blood and therefore can't apprentice as a surgeon like his
					older brother. Despite these shortcomings, he is full of enthusiasm and cheer. Tien adores his older brother and is often the best one to comfort Kaladin.
					Tien loves to collect rocks that he finds special; others often find them more benign than he, but there is always something distinct that he can see.
					At age 13 Tien was conscripted by a passing army, his brother and father were immune since they were the village surgeon and apprentice. 
				</p>
		<h2>Experiences</h2>
			<p>
				Kaladin grew up training to be a surgeon under his father. Kaladin always struggled with losing patients and his father worked hard to help him form mental
				calluses. Being the only boy besides Tien of second nahn in his hometown, he was an outcast due to jealousy from the other boys. Virtually every young Alethi
				boy dreams of going off to war to win a shardblade. While there are many tales of darkeyed men winning a shardblade, the event hasn't happened within the
				last several hundred years. One day he got into a fight	with an older boy and almost won. Learning of his natural talent for fighting led to Kaladin considering
				running off to become a soldier, though eventually decided against it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Years later when Tien was conscripted, Kaladin decided to enlist with the same army so he could protect Tien. Four months after	Tien's conscription
				he died in battle. Tien's death broke Kaladin who swore to never let another person he loved die in battle. He trained ceaselessly and became the youngest
				darkeyed squadleader in the entire army. It was during this time that he received the nickname "Stormblessed" because of his great prowess in battle and the
				shockingly low casualty rate within his squad. This high survival rate is especially notable since Kaladin actively recruited all the young boys in the army
				because they reminded him of Tien.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was in this circumstance that Kaladin managed to kill an enemy shardbearer by ramming a dagger through the eye-slit of the armor. The shardbearer was a
				failed assassin of Kaladin's general: Amaram. General Amaram was know for his honor and fair treatment of his men, light and darkeyed. In Kaladin's attack of
				the shardbearer, almost all of his squadmembers were cut down. After killing the assassin, Kaladin couldn't stand to take the weapon that had slew so many of
				his friends. Kaladin instead gave it to one of his men. After the battle, Kaladin and his few remaining men were called to Amaram's command tent. Here Amaram
				betrayed Kaladin and took the shards from him. Amaram killed Kaladin's remaining men to keep the secret and then branded Kaladin as a slave to assuage his
				conscience. Kaladin was thrust into a deep hatred and depression by Amaram's betrayal. He thought that Amaram was different from the rest of the petty and
				power hungry lighteyes, but Kaladin was ultimately proven wrong.
